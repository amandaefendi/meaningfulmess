# Uni Projects
A repository of my past data science projects!

- Portugal Student Data 2018
    - R Studio
    - Running a classification machine learning algorithm on high school student data in Portugal to predict their likelihood of failing or passing a class

- Census Data 2018
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - Exploratory data analysis on census data

- Election Data Program Menu 2018
    - Python
    - Creating an input based program that can display and provide customised outputs of the election data. Using many different data structures as the underlying design.

- Estimating GIIP Values by Simulation 2019
    - R Studio
    - Running simulations of several oil reservoirs using their parameters to try to estimate the actual oil volume inside

- Bank Note Classification 2019
    - R Studio
    - Classifying bank notes into real and fake using several machine learning algorithms SVM, LDA, Logistic, etc and test their efficiency

- SVM and ANN Efficiency Test on Simulated Time Series Data 2019
    - R Studio
    - Compare the accuracy between Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network in predicting simulated time series data

- WA Super 2019
